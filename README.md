### What I learned


While working on this project, I learned and applied several key concepts in web development, including:

HTML Structure: I gained experience in creating a well-structured HTML document, including using semantic tags for content sections, setting up the viewport, and including essential metadata.

CSS Styling: I practiced CSS styling techniques such as defining background colors, setting text and font styles, and creating responsive layouts. This involved setting margins and padding, using border-radius for rounded corners, bow shadows, and aligning content.

Image Handling: I worked with images in HTML, including setting image attributes like alt for accessibility and ensuring images scale appropriately with different screen sizes.

Flexbox and Centering: I used flexbox to center content both vertically and horizontally, creating a visually appealing and responsive design.

Media Queries: I implemented a media query for smaller screens, allowing the layout to adapt to different devices and screen sizes.

External Resources: I practiced linking external resources, such as fonts and images, in my HTML document.

Accessibility: I improved the accessibility of my project by adding descriptive alt text to images, enhancing the overall user experience.

In summary, this project allowed me to apply fundamental HTML and CSS skills to create a responsive and visually appealing web component. These skills are valuable for building more complex web applications and websites in the future.

### Continued development

HTML5, CSS, and Javascript.
